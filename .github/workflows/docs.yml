# GitHub Pages requires a root `index.html` to function properly.
# This job does a few things to make sure this works:
# - Runs the Nightly channel of Rust
# - Passes the `--enable-index-page` flag to Rustdoc; since this
#   is an unstable feature, this requires Nightly Rust and also
#   passing the `-Zunstable-options` flag
#
# See:
# - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/unstable-features.html#--enable-index-page-generate-a-default-index-page-for-docs
